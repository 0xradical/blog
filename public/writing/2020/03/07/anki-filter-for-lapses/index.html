<p>It's been 2 months since I've begun studying kanji using <a href="https://massimmersionapproach.com/table-of-contents/stage-1/practice/recognition-rtk/">MIA's Recognition RTK Deck</a> on Anki 2. As is natural to happen, I've fallen victim to my own memories shortcomings and have forgotten some cards I thought I had already mastered.</p>
<p>Now, if I forget some cards too often, Anki marks those cards as leeches, based on a metric called lapse. Lapse is how many times I unlearned a card. When a certain threshold of lapses occur, Anki marks that card as a leech, and you have to deal with it manually (either by coming up with a better mnemonic or discarding that card altogether).</p>
<p>If you choose the fixing route, then it's not enough to fix the card. You have to manually remove the &quot;leech&quot; tag and reset that card. Resetting is fundamental because you rebuilt the card, creating a potential new learning path in your brain when Anki shows that card to you.</p>
<p>To reset the card, I use Anki filters and look for cards for which the lapse is above the current deck threshold, like this:</p>
