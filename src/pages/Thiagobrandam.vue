    <h1>Why thiagobrandam ?</h1>
    <p class='a-mt(1em)'>
      My full name is Thiago Brandão Damasceno. 13-year-old me thought
      it was clever to pick a subset of each name (thiago+bran+dam) and use
      it as nickname. Turns out thiagobrandam is a lot like thiago brandão in pt-br,
      so not such a good idea after all. But by the time I realized it, I'd been
      using it in all sorts of places (emails, websites, ...) and already built an
      online persona around it (albeit almost non-existent) and now I'm stuck with it :)
